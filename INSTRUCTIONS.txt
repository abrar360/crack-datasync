Suppose that our goal is the following:

Build a production-ready data ingestion system that extracts event data from the DataSync Analytics API and stores it in a PostgreSQL database.


Requirements:
Our solution must:
1. Run entirely in Docker using the provided `docker-compose.yml`
2. Work with the command: `sh run-ingestion.sh`

Must Have
1. TypeScript codebase
2. PostgreSQL for data storage
3. Docker Compose for running your solution
4. Proper error handling and logging
5. Rate limit handling - respect the API limits
6. Resumable ingestion - if the process crashes, it should resume from where it left off

Notes:
Suppose you and I will work as a team.

I will go in and explore the API thoroughly and report back on the endpoints and how they should be called.

You will design and produce the data ingestion system according to the requirements.


Suppose you start in a root directory that only has the following two files:
- docker-compose.yml
- run-ingestion.sh

First, before we do anything. I want you to carefully analyze these files and describe exactly what you will be producing.
